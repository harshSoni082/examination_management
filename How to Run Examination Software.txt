Starting Docker
in Powershell write 
 >> net start vmcompute
>> wsl --set-default-version 2

ow open Docker 


To work from scratch 
delete all things from container in docker 

C:\Users\Mann\Desktop\examination_management> docker container rm $(docker container ls -a)
C:\Users\Mann\Desktop\examination_management> docker rm -f $(docker volume ls)


agian isntal everything
C:\Users\Mann\Desktop\examination_management> docker-compose -f local.yml up

How to share your container with others

First Lets create a docker container from an image 
> docker run --name mysoftware imagename:latest

Then see if container is created or not 
> docker ps 
note down the id of running continer suppose it is 345
now you have to first make image of this runnig container in order to oush it to docer hub

> docker commit 345 usernameofdockerhub/directorry_on_which_you wish to store the imgae : any tag name

> docker commit 345 mukesh311a/Examsoftware: latest

Lets see what image it has created 
> dockre image 

now push that image to docer hub 
>docker push imageName: tagname   --> docker push mukesh311a/Examsoftware: latest

Now take a pull or directly run the command as

>docker run --name examination_sofware mukesh311/exams_django

>docker run --name adminer  mukesh311/adminer

>docker run --name postgres mukesh311/postgres

**********************************************************

You can download the mysql data base and then on a new laptop just place the examination_management code n desktopn and then cd to exam

cd to examnation_maagement 
then run following command 
>docker compose -f local.yml.up

open localhost:8080

put all credentials  as described above

now delete the data base examination_management and then again create a  fresh dtabase weith the name examination _mamanehemet
now upload the .sql file to this data base .

Always take database backup to loacl drive once the semeesnetr is over so that you can easly migrate from one to other laptop easily
